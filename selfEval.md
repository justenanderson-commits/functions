# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
I feel like my time management is pretty good in general. I can tend to over-focus and forget to take breaks, or remember to take one and then go too long. So I'm trying to work on that balance. If I knew how long the exercises (typically) took to complete, I'd be much more inclined to calendar them and follow the schedule. However, I just have to work until an organic stopping point and then set a timer on my phone for the length of time I give myself for a break.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
A function is a like a button you can push that does things for you. Like when we press the power button the computer, it turns on, lights come on, we can hear sounds, and we can see the screen. However, if the button isn't pushed, the computer will just sit there waiting for something to happen.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
Parameters are like variables (in functions). We can declare them in our functions, but they will be undefined until we do so with an argument when the function is called. Arguments are like the definition (or assignment value) of the "variable" that gets passed into the function when it's called.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
I'm curious how everyone else improved the functions in the cleanUp exercises and will be interested to hear their thoughts. I feel like I did an okay job, but there's certainly things I could have done better.
